function y = probit_f_chi2(x, varying_p, fixed_p)% this function calculates a scaled probit function with the values of xm = varying_p(1); % "pivot point" of perf. change, the trial at which you get 50% of the learnings = varying_p(2); % speed of learning - is it a slow learning or a sharp sudden learning at pivot pointi = varying_p(3); % initial perf.f = varying_p(4); % final perf.y = probit_f(x, m, s, i ,f);
